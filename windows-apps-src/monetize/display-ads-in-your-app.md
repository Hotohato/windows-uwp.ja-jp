The Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK gives you several ways to monetize your app with ads.

## Banner and video ads from Microsoft

Make more money from your Windows apps by including video and banner ads from Microsoft. The ads show in Windows apps for PCs, tablets, and phones. You can monitor your ad performance in real time by using the Windows Dev Center dashboard.

To include ads from Microsoft in your apps, use the Microsoft Store Engagement and Monetization SDK. Use the following resources to get started.
